A binary tree in CoffeeScript

This project includes a class to store information using a binary tree structure (binary_tree.coffee) and a class to draw a binary tree (binary_tree_drawer.coffee)

* File binary_console.coffee shows an example of how to use the binary tree and the binary tree drawer from a node.js console application

* File binary_web.coffee shows an example on how to use the binary_tree and the binary_tree_drawer to actually draw a binary tree in a web page using HTML 5 canvas element.
